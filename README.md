## 📚 Template Library

All templates live in the `docs/` folder in markdown format.  
They support modular reuse, audit-friendly workflows, and emotionally intelligent compliance.

Templates include:
- Compliance Checklist ✅
- Incident Response Playbook 🚨
- Data Flow Assessment 🔄
- Audit Ownership Matrix 🧮
- Vendor Security Questionnaire 🔐
- Privacy Impact Assessment 🕵️‍♀️
- Vendor Risk Scoring Matrix 📊
- Business Continuity Plan Outline 🧭
- Customer Data Request Response Process 📬

Each template includes completion guidance, evidence prompts, and stewardship logic.  
Canonical versions remain in markdown to preserve formatting and remixability.

## 🔄 Version Enhancements (Planned, Time Permitting)

Future versions may include:
- Automated service mapping and data flow documentation  
- Integration with IAM Hygiene Scanner and stewardship badge logic  
- GitHub Actions for template generation and audit updates  

These enhancements will extend the Visual Disclosure Ledger into a living system of record—quietly mapping, documenting, and stewarding technical ecosystems with dignity.

To follow development or contribute with care, see the `enhancements/` folder (coming soon).
