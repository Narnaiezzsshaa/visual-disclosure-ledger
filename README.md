The Visual Disclosure Ledger is a shared visibility tool for SMBs and vendors to co-document how sensitive data moves, where it lives, and who owns audit responsibility. It replaces vague assurances with legible architecture.

## 🎯 Overview

In today's interconnected business environment, small and medium businesses (SMBs) often struggle with data governance when working with third-party vendors. Traditional vendor assurances like "we're SOC2 compliant" or "your data is secure" lack the granular visibility needed for effective risk management.

The Visual Disclosure Ledger Framework provides a structured approach to create shared accountability between SMBs and their vendors, ensuring complete transparency in data handling practices.

## 📍 What It Captures

### **Data Flow Paths**
- Complete journey from source systems to vendor endpoints
- Data transformation points and processing stages
- Integration touchpoints and handoff protocols
- Real-time visibility into data movement patterns

### **Storage Points** 
- Cloud buckets (S3, Azure Blob, GCS)
- Database instances (RDS, MongoDB, PostgreSQL)
- Third-party vaults and encrypted storage
- Temporary processing locations and caches

### **Audit Ownership**
- Clear assignment of logging responsibilities
- Review and monitoring ownership at each stage
- Incident response and anomaly handling protocols
- Compliance reporting and documentation duties

## 🧭 Architecture Overview

## 🏗️ Implementation Guide

### Step 1: Data Flow Mapping
1. **Identify Source Systems**: Catalog all internal systems that generate or store sensitive data
2. **Document Integration Points**: Map every API endpoint, webhook, and data transfer mechanism
3. **Trace Data Pathways**: Follow data from origin to final destination, including all intermediate stops

### Step 2: Storage Documentation
1. **Inventory Storage Locations**: List all databases, file systems, and cloud storage used
2. **Classification by Sensitivity**: Label storage points by data sensitivity levels
3. **Access Control Mapping**: Document who has access to what data at each location

### Step 3: Audit Ownership Assignment
1. **Define Responsibility Matrix**: Clearly assign logging, monitoring, and response duties
2. **Establish SLAs**: Set expectations for response times and escalation procedures
3. **Create Review Cadence**: Schedule regular audits and compliance checks

## 📊 Responsibility Matrix

| **Component** | **Vendor Owns** | **Shared Responsibility** | **Client Owns** |
|---------------|-----------------|---------------------------|-----------------|
| **Infrastructure** | Server monitoring, uptime | Capacity planning | Usage policies |
| **Security** | Platform hardening | Access reviews | User management |
| **Compliance** | Certifications | Audit coordination | Internal controls |
| **Incident Response** | System incidents | Communication | Business impact |
| **Data Retention** | Technical deletion | Policy alignment | Retention schedules |
