# ðŸ“Š Vendor Risk Scoring Matrix

## Purpose
Quantitative assessment framework for evaluating and monitoring vendor security and compliance risks with weighted criteria and actionable scoring guidance.

## Scoring Methodology

### Risk Categories & Weights
| Category | Weight | Rationale |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| **Data Security** | 30% | Highest impact on compliance and breach risk |
| **Compliance Posture** | 25% | Regulatory requirements and audit findings |
| **Business Continuity** | 20% | Service availability and disaster recovery |
| **Access Controls** | 15% | Identity management and privilege controls |
| **Vendor Stability** | 10% | Financial health and business longevity |

### Scoring Scale
- **1**: Excellent (minimal risk, industry best practices)
- **2**: Good (acceptable risk, standard practices)
- **3**: Fair (moderate risk, some concerns)
- **4**: Poor (high risk, significant gaps)
- **5**: Critical (unacceptable risk, immediate action required)
