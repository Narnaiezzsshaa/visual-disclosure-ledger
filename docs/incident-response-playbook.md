# ðŸš¨ Incident Response Playbook

## Purpose
Coordinate fast, transparent response to security incidents with clear escalation paths and communication protocols.

## Severity Classification

| Severity | Definition | Examples | Initial Response Time |
|----------|------------|----------|----------------------|
| **Low** | Minor issue, no customer impact, limited scope | Failed login attempts, minor config drift | 24 hours |
| **Medium** | Service degradation, internal impact only | API slowdown, internal system outage | 4 hours |
| **High** | Customer impact, potential data exposure | PHI access by unauthorized user, external breach attempt | 1 hour |
| **Critical** | Confirmed data breach, legal/regulatory exposure | Ransomware, confirmed PHI exfiltration, system compromise | 15 minutes |

## Response Timeline & Actions

| Severity | Detection | Confirmation | Escalation | Containment | Recovery | Post-Incident |
|----------|-----------|--------------|------------|-------------|----------|---------------|
| **Low** | 24h | 48h | Internal only | 72h | 5 days | 2 weeks |
| **Medium** | 4h | 8h | IT Manager | 12h | 2 days | 1 week |
| **High** | 1h | 2h | Executive team | 4h | 24h | 72h |
| **Critical** | 15m | 30m | CEO + Legal | 1h | 8h | 48h |

## Decision Tree

### Initial Assessment Questions
1. **Is customer data involved?** â†’ If yes, escalate to High/Critical
2. **Are external systems affected?** â†’ If yes, notify vendors immediately
3. **Is this a suspected attack?** â†’ If yes, preserve evidence before containment
4. **Do we need legal counsel?** â†’ If data breach or regulatory impact, engage legal

### Escalation Triggers
- **Automatically escalate to Critical if:**
  - PHI/PII confirmed accessed by unauthorized parties
  - Ransomware or malware detected
  - External threat actor confirmed in environment
  - Regulatory notification requirements triggered

## Communication Protocols

### Internal Notification (Required)
- **Immediate**: Security team, IT Manager
- **Within 1 hour**: Executive team (High/Critical only)
- **Within 4 hours**: All staff (Critical only)

### External Notification (As Required)
- **Customers**: Within 24-72 hours depending on impact
- **Vendors**: Immediately if their systems affected
- **Regulatory**: Per legal requirements (typically 72 hours)
- **Law Enforcement**: For criminal activity or as legally required
