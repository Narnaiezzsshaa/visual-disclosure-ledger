# ðŸ§® Audit Ownership Matrix

## Purpose
Clarifies audit responsibilities across internal teams, vendors, and shared environments. Supports modular reuse, evidence mapping, and emotionally literate stewardship.

## Completion Guidance
- Use RACI logic: **Responsible** = executes the work; **Accountable** = signs off and ensures completion; **Consulted** = provides input; **Informed** = kept in the loop
- Start with known controls from your Compliance Checklist or vendor questionnaire
- Map shared responsibilities in hybrid or co-managed environments
- Review quarterly to align with stewardship cycles and organizational changes
- Link to SOPs, contracts, or audit logs in adjacent columns if needed

## Stewardship Logic & Emotional Hygiene

### Principles for Respectful Audit Ownership
- **Clarity over Control**: Focus on clear expectations rather than rigid authority
- **Dignity in Delegation**: Honor the expertise and autonomy of responsible parties
- **Repair-Oriented**: When issues arise, focus on learning and improvement rather than blame
- **Proportionate Response**: Match the effort to the actual risk and impact

### Common Friction Points & Resolutions
| Friction Point | Root Cause | Resolution Approach |
|----------------|------------|-------------------|
| "Not my job" responses | Unclear ownership or excessive burden | Clarify scope, redistribute workload, provide training |
| Vendor finger-pointing | Ambiguous contract terms | Update contracts, create joint playbooks |
| Audit fatigue | Over-auditing or redundant requests | Consolidate reviews, automate where possible |
| Executive bypass | Lack of buy-in or understanding | Improve communication, demonstrate value |

## Implementation Guidance

### Getting Started
1. **Map Current State**: Document who actually performs each audit function today
2. **Identify Gaps**: Note where responsibility is unclear or unassigned
3. **Assign Ownership**: Use existing roles and expertise, create new roles only if necessary
4. **Document Procedures**: Link each responsibility to specific procedures or SOPs
5. **Communicate Changes**: Ensure all stakeholders understand their roles

### Maintenance
- **Quarterly Reviews**: Update matrix based on organizational changes
- **Annual Deep Dive**: Reassess effectiveness and adjust based on audit findings
- **Continuous Improvement**: Collect feedback from responsible parties and adjust processes

### Success Metrics
- **Audit Findings**: Track reduction in findings related to unclear ownership
- **Response Times**: Monitor improvement in issue resolution times
- **Stakeholder Satisfaction**: Survey responsible parties on clarity and fairness
- **Compliance Scores**: Measure overall compliance posture improvement
