## Business Impact Analysis

### Critical Business Functions

| Function | Description | Impact if Down | RTO* | RPO** | Priority |
|----------|-------------|----------------|------|-------|----------|
| Patient Lookup | EHR access for patient records | Unable to provide care | 2 hours | 15 minutes | Critical |
